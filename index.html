    <h2>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h2>
  
<div>
  <p>The College of Industrial Technology (CIT) is located in Laoag City,<br>
     with an external campus in PaoayIlocos Norte. It was chosen in 1983 <br>
     as one of the 21 public technological institutes in the Technical Vocational <br>
      Education Project (TVEP) of the then Department of Education,Culture, and <br>
       Sports (DECS) mandated to produce the needed manpower for industrial <br> growth 
        and development in the country.The college was an accredited <br> regional trade 
         skills training and testing center in Region 1 by the Technical <br> Education 
          and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and a regional <br> training center in 
           ceramic by the Product Design and Development Center <br> of the Philippines.It
           also hosts a Toyota Technology Center (TTC), one <br>among 18 established in 
           nominated partner schools in the country under <br> the Toyota Automotive Education 
           Program (TAEP) of the Toyota Motor <br>Philippines Foundation (TMPF) Inc., which is 
            envisioned to become the <br> regional skills development center in automotive servicing. </p>

    <p>The University is Deputized by CHED to implement the Expanded Tertiary <br>
        Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP) with the <br>
         BS INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY as one of the ETEEAP Degree Programs offered <br>
          by the College. The ETEEAP is a comprehensive educational assessment <br>
           program at the tertiary level that recognizes, accredits, and gives <br>
            equivalencies to knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values gained by <br>
            individuals from relevant work. <br>
       This program recognizes that education and the acquisition of higher <br>
        expertise also take place beyond the confines of the classroom. The BSIT <br>
        degree may be granted to individuals through the recognition of their <br>
        knowledge and skills gained from non-formal or informal learning. The <br>
         recognition of the knowledge and skills are done through equivalency <br>
         and assessment by assessors of the College. <br></p>
